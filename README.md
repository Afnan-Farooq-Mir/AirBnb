Airbnb Data Analysis Project Report  Project Overview  This project analyzes Airbnb listings to gain insights into pricing, availability, and host activity. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and processed using Python (Pandas) in Jupyter Notebook, followed by visualization and KPI generation in Power BI.



Steps Undertaken

Data Acquisition:

Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.

Imported it into Jupyter Notebook for analysis.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Identified and handled missing values by either filling them with appropriate values or dropping unnecessary columns.

Ensured data consistency by checking for duplicates and correcting data types.

Saved the cleaned dataset as a CSV file for further analysis in Power BI.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed distribution of room types, pricing trends, and availability.

Examined correlations between pricing and factors such as location, number of reviews, and availability.

Identified outliers in price and minimum night stays to refine insights.

Visualization and Dashboard Creation in Power BI:

Imported the cleaned dataset into Power BI.

Created interactive visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, and slicers.

Developed Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for price distribution, average availability, and top-performing hosts.

Built a dynamic and interactive dashboard for effective data-driven decision-making.

Key Insights

Neighborhood Trends: Certain neighborhoods have significantly higher average prices and availability.

Room Type Preferences: Entire home/apt listings tend to have higher pricing than private/shared rooms.

Host Activity: Some hosts manage multiple listings, affecting price competitiveness.

Seasonal Impact: Availability and pricing fluctuate based on time of year and demand.

Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas) & Jupyter Notebook – For data cleaning and preprocessing.

Power BI – For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

Conclusion

This project provided insights into Airbnb listing trends and enabled better decision-making through data visualization. The combination of Python and Power BI streamlined the process from data cleaning to actionable insights.
